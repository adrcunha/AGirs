<div class="textblock"><p>This project implements a <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girs.html">Girs server</a> for the Arduino. That is, it is an interactive server that can send and receive IR signals, with some bells and whistles. The interactive server is mainly meant for interact with other programs. communicating over a serial line (likely in USB disguise), or TCP-sockets.</p>
<p>It is build on top of the low-level library called <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Infrared4Arduino">Infrared4Arduino</a>.</p>
<p>The main content of the project is an applications, <em>Girs</em> (including the "light" version <em>GirsLite</em>), which constitutes the server. There is also another application, <em>Listener</em>, which is a uni-directional program that just emits decodes on the serial interface. (It can for example to be used in conjunction with my Java program <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/dispatcher">dispatcher</a>). Finally, there is a IR-to-serial demonstration program; an IR to serial converter (<em>Opponator</em>). These application are found as subdirectories of the directory <code>examples</code>. The subdirectory <code>src</code> contains a fairly small amount of supporting functionality, forming a library in the traditional Arduino sense.</p>
<p>This slighty unlogical organization is due to the wish to be compatible with the current <a href="https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5:-Library-specification">Arduino library specification</a>, required/desired for inclusion in the Arduino library manager. (There is presently no "Arduino application manager".)</p>
<p>For compilation with the Arduino IDE, the library <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Infrared4Arduino">Infrared4Arduino</a> and, preferably, the <a href="https://github.com/marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C">LiquidCrystal_I2C</a> (version 1.1.2 or later) should be installed with the Arduino library manager.</p>
<h2>Configuration files</h2>
<p>It is a modular program that is heavily based on CPP symbols, defined in the configuration file <code><a class="el" href="Girs_2config_8h.html">examples/Girs/config.h</a></code>. This determines the capacities of the compiled program, and adapts the configuration to the underlying hardware. The options are (somewhat) documented in <code><a class="el" href="GirsFat_8config_8h.html">examples/Girs/GirsFat.config.h</a></code>. Not all combination are sensible or implemented. Some, but not all, of the non-sensible combinations will be detected and will generate a compilation error.</p>
<p>If the preprocessor symbol <code>LCD</code> is defined in <code><a class="el" href="LedLcdManager_8cpp.html">src/GirsLib/LedLcdManager.cpp</a></code> (which is the default, except for the Arduino Micro), the library is configured with support for the LCD display, regardless of the settings in <code>config.h</code>.</p>
<h3>Ethernet support</h3>
<p>If using an Ethernet shield with W5500 or W5200 chip, be sure that the Ethernet library version 2.0.0 or later is used, since it supports all W5*00 chips, auto-detecting during runtime.</p>
<p>This applies both to the Girs application as well as to the Listener.</p>
<h2>Hardware configuration</h2>
<p>I have written a <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/arduino_nano.html">fairly detailed description</a> of using an Arduino Nano (clone) by soldering suitable components to the PCB. This is a small handy gadget at the size of a (large) stamp and the price of a (small) pizza, perfect for using with IrScrutinizer and Lirc.</p>
<p>The hardware configuration is determined by including a suitable header file. It describes the attach sensor(s) and the pins they are connected to. To allow soldering sensors directly to the holes in some boards, the program supports defining e.g. <code>SENSOR_GND</code> and <code>SENSOR_VSS</code>, which will make the program define these pins as digital outputs, being fed by constant 0 and 5 volts respectively.</p>
<p>Note that the sending pin and the capture pin (as opposed to the receive pin) are not configurable, but has to follow the following table:</p>
<pre>
                          Sender Pin      Capture Pin
Uno/Nano (ATmega328P)          3             8
Leonardo/Micro (ATmega32U4)    9             4
Mega2560 (ATmega2560)          9            49
</pre><h2>Sending non-modulated signals.</h2>
<p>RF signals (433 MHz and other carrier frequencies) do not use the IR typical modulation. Also there are a few IR protocols (like <a href="http://www.hifi-remote.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=14186&amp;start=40">Revox, Barco, Archer</a>) not using modulation. These signals can be sent by defining the symbol <code>NON_MOD</code>, and connecting some hardware capable of sending non-modulated signals (IR- <em>or</em> RF-) to the GPIO pin defined as <code>NON_MOD_PIN</code>. Then transmitted signals having frequency 0 will be directed to that device. (Later versions may use different syntax and semantic.)</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>The flashed unit can be tested with a standard terminal program, like the serial monitor of the Arduino IDE. For this, set the baud rate to 115200, and the line ending to carriage return. It is now possible to communicate with the unit using the <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girs.html">commands of Girs</a>. Just type the command to the program, and the unit will respond. Exactly which commands are available depends on the configuration. In all cases, the <code>version</code> and the <code>modules</code> commands are available. If <code>receive</code> is implemented, just type "`r`" (without the quotes), followed by return, and fire a suitable IR signal at the receiver. The raw capture will be output to the terminal program. Using the clipboard, it can be pasted to IrScrutinizer, and analyzed. Of course, also the other commands can be tested in this way.</p>
<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/Infrared4Arduino"><code>Infrared4Arduino</code></a> by myself. Current version is 1.0.1. Can be installed by the library manager within the Arduino IDE. (Sketch -&gt; Include library -&gt; Manage libraries, name Infrared (Category: Others)).</li>
<li><code>Ethernet</code>, preferably version 2.0.0 or later.</li>
<li><code>SPI</code> (if enabling the <code>ETHERNET</code> or <code>LCD_I2C</code> configure option). Contained in the Arduino IDE.</li>
<li><code>Wire</code> (if enabling the <code>LCD_I2C</code> configure option). Contained in the Arduino IDE.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/marcoschwartz/LiquidCrystal_I2C"><code>LiquidCrystal_I2C</code></a> version 1.1.2 or later. Available in the Arduino library manager. If the preprocessor symbol <code>LCD</code> is defined in <code><a class="el" href="LedLcdManager_8cpp.html">src/GirsLib/LedLcdManager.cpp</a></code>, this is needed also if not actually using an LCD display.</li>
<li>(Optional) <a href="https://github.com/bengtmartensson/ABeacon"><code>Beacon</code></a> for an AMX compatible Ethernet beacon. It is also available in the Arduino library manager with the name <code>Beacon</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Questions and answers</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do I setup Lirc to use this?</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the <code>girs</code> driver contained in the recent official upstream Lirc distribution. This is described <a href="http://lirc.org/html/girs.html">here</a>. also contained in the (recent) distro as <code>girs.html</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are Makefiles doing in an Arduino project?</li>
</ul>
<p>To build the project for the Arduino, use the Arduino IDE from <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software">arduino.cc</a>, as in most Arduino projects. The Makefile is used for building a "Software-in-the-loop" test version for the PC; of interest for developers only.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the difference between <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Glossary.html#ReceivingIrSignals">"receive"</a> and <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Glossary.html#Capturing">"capture"</a>?</li>
</ul>
<p>Please follow the links given. Differently put, "receive" uses a demodulating receiver, "capture" a non-demodulating decoder. Note that this is not universally accepted terminology (yet!).</p>
<ul>
<li>What Ethernet modules are supported?</li>
</ul>
<p>Only cards based on the W5100, W5200, and W5500 chip (and compatible), like the <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">official shield</a>. There are both cheap clones of the original available, as well as smallish W5100-based cards.</p>
<p>Also the next generation of W5500 based shields, like the official <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoEthernetShield">Arduino Ethernet Shield 2</a> work. For this, use the <code>Ethernet</code> library version 2.0.0 (or later).</p>
<ul>
<li>What about "GirsLite"?</li>
</ul>
<p>As indicated by the name, it is a minimalist Girs server for the Arduino, that implements only the <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girs.html#Capture">capture</a> and the <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/Girs.html#Transmit">transmit</a> modules, without all options. It is meant to be used with <a href="http://www.harctoolbox.org/IrScrutinizer.html">IrScrutinizer</a> versions 1.1.0 or later, as well as with Lirc, using the Lirc <code>girs</code> driver by yours truly. Documentation is found with the <a href="http://lirc.org/html/girs">Lirc driver</a>, in the Lirc sources the file <code>girs.html</code>.</p>
<p>It is not an independent program, it is just AGirs with certain options enabled, namely the CPP symbols <code>TRANSMIT, CAPTURE, LED</code>, and (optionally) <code>NON_MOD</code> defined. Alternatively, if <code>RECEIVE</code> is defined, but not <code>CAPTURE</code>, the program mimics the capture command with a demodulating sensor, for usage with IrScrutinizer without a non-demodulating sensor.</p>
<ul>
<li>Were did the <code>example/GirsLite</code> directory go?</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been merged with <code>examples/Girs</code>. To build GirsLite, make sure that <code>examples/config.h</code> is configured as you desire.</p>
<ul>
<li>What about Girs4Lirc?</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Now discontinued</em>, replaced by GirsLite. Just as GirsLite, this was just a certain configuration of AGirs, "optimized" for Lirc, supporting <code>TRANSMIT, NON_MOD</code> (optionally), <code>RECEIVE, LED, LCD, DECODE</code> (only to the LCD), <code>TRANSMITTERS</code> (only a dummy implementation).</p>
<ul>
<li>Can I keep and maintain the library configuration in another location, for example together with my own sketch?</li>
</ul>
<p>No, the present Arduino IDE does not support this. I an not aware of a clean solution. Sorry. Fiddling with the library's <code>config.h</code> for project specific configurations defeats the very idea of a library.</p>
<ul>
<li>How is "Girs" pronounced?</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pronounced like in "girl". The "language" Girs is written capitalized, the name of an implementation is usually written in lower case.</p>
