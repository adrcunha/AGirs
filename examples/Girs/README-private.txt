This is the branch "private".

"private" does not mean "secret" or "keep out". Rather, these files are
for use by the developer, and are not likely meaningful for anyone else.
Feel free to study them though.

The config.h is symbolic link. If checked out on Windows, it will likely be
nonsensical. Too bad...
